# LIPASE Dataset

## Overview
The **LIPASE** (LTE-based dIgital array PAssive SEnsing system) dataset contains experimental data for passive UAV tracking using LTE downlink signals and digital antenna arrays. This dataset was collected as part of the research presented in:

> **"An Experimental Study of Passive UAV Tracking with Digital Arrays and Cellular Downlink Signals"**  
> *Yifei Sun, Chao Yu, Yan Luo, Haisheng Tan, Rui Wang, Francis C. M. Lau*  
> **[Preprint available on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20788)**

The dataset is designed to support research in **passive radar, UAV tracking, and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC)** by providing raw and processed data from real-world experiments.

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following components:

<!--- **Raw IQ Samples**: Baseband signals collected by software-defined radios (SDRs) from LTE downlink transmissions.-->
<!--- - **Preprocessed Signals**: Interference-suppressed signals.-->
- **Range-Doppler Maps**: Processing results from cross-ambiguity function calculations.
- **Matlab Scripts**: Scripts to read the range-Doppler maps and plot the GPS data on map.

## Experiment Setup
- **Transmitter**: Commercial LTE eNB operating at 2130â€“2135 MHz.
- **Receiver**: Passive sensing system with two uniform linear antenna arrays (ULAs).
- **Target**: UAV flying a circle trajectory while reflecting LTE signals.
- **Baseline Distance**: 255 meters between eNB and LIPASE receiver.
- **Sampling Rate**: 25 MHz.
